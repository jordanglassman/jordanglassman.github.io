This backdated post is a marker post, meant to celebrate the day this blog was actually born on my hard drive, as well as to contain meta
thoughts about this blog's purpose, etc.

#### Purposes
1. Keep my fingers in things like HTML, CSS, Markdown, the CLI, Ruby while I continue to do Java and Android professionally.
2. Give myself in-depth knowledge of Java internals.
3. Boost my overall Java expertise by reading and commenting on code.
4. Find ideas and exercises for writing code at the margins of the Java standard libraries.
